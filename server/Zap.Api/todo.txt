Docker / Local Run
- Build image: `docker build -t zap-api:local server`
- Run with Postgres (example):
  `docker run --rm -p 5090:80 -e ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=host.docker.internal;Port=5432;Database=zap_dev;Username=postgres;Password=postgres" zap-api:local`

Notes:
- The container listens on port 80 (ASPNETCORE_URLS set). Use env var `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` to provide the DB.
- On startup the app will attempt to apply EF Core migrations automatically; errors are logged.
